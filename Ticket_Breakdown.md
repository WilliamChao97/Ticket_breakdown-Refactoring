# Ticket Breakdown
We are a staffing company whose primary purpose is to book Agents at Shifts posted by Facilities on our platform. We're working on a new feature which will generate reports for our client Facilities containing info on how many hours each Agent worked in a given quarter by summing up every Shift they worked. Currently, this is how the process works:

- Data is saved in the database in the Facilities, Agents, and Shifts tables
- A function `getShiftsByFacility` is called with the Facility's id, returning all Shifts worked that quarter, including some metadata about the Agent assigned to each
- A function `generateReport` is then called with the list of Shifts. It converts them into a PDF which can be submitted by the Facility for compliance.

## You've been asked to work on a ticket. It reads:

**Currently, the id of each Agent on the reports we generate is their internal database id. We'd like to add the ability for Facilities to save their own custom ids for each Agent they work with and use that id when generating reports for them.**


Based on the information given, break this ticket down into 2-5 individual tickets to perform. Provide as much detail for each ticket as you can, including acceptance criteria, time/effort estimates, and implementation details. Feel free to make informed guesses about any unknown details - you can't guess "wrong".


You will be graded on the level of detail in each ticket, the clarity of the execution plan within and between tickets, and the intelligibility of your language. You don't need to be a native English speaker, but please proof-read your work.

   - A new custom_id field has been added to the Facilities table in the database.
   - Facilities can add a custom ID for each Agent they work with via the application.
   - The custom ID for each Agent is unique for each Facility and is linked to the specific Agent's ID.
3. Time/Effort Estimate: 1-2 hours
4. Implementation Details:
   - Modify the Facilities table schema to include a custom_id field.
   - Add a custom ID input field to the Facility view in the application.
   - Store and link the custom ID to the specific Agent's ID in the database.

### Ticket 2: Update Reports to use custom IDs instead of database IDs

1. Description: Modify the report generation process to use the custom IDs provided by Facilities instead of the internal database IDs for Agents.
2. Acceptance Criteria:
   - Reports generated by the system show the custom IDs provided by Facilities instead of the internal database IDs for Agents.
3. Time/Effort Estimate: 2-3 hours
4. Implementation Details:
   - Update the `generateReport` function to retrieve the custom IDs for each Agent from the Facilities table instead of the internal database IDs.
   - Render the custom IDs instead of the internal database IDs in the report.

### Ticket 3: Update Shifts metadata to include custom IDs

1. Description: Update the metadata for each Shift to include the custom IDs provided by Facilities for the Agents assigned to them.
2. Acceptance Criteria:
   - `getShiftsByFacility` function now returns Shifts metadata that includes custom IDs provided by Facilities for the Agents assigned to them.
3. Time/Effort Estimate: 1-2 hours
4. Implementation Details:
   - Update the query in `getShiftsByFacility` to include the custom IDs of the Agents assigned to the Shifts retrieved.
   - Update the Shifts metadata returned by the function to include the custom IDs.

 Note: While not explicitly stated, it may be necessary to update the user interface and user experience of the application to support the new feature. This would likely require its own separate ticket and effort estimate.
